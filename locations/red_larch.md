# Red Larch

The town of Red Larch is a waystop on the Long Road seven days north of [Waterdeep][Waterdeep] and is located at the intersection of three trails. One trail leads to the Bargewright Inn, another to Kheldell, and the third runs into the hills to derelict, monster-infested keeps. The town was named for a stand of red larch trees that were chopped down about the time of the town's founding.
