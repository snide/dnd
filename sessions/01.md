# S1: The Assault on Lance Rock

**Tuesday, September 13**

Our party awakens in a fine room in [The Swinging Sword Inn][Inn], but how did they get here?


## A Terrible Headache

[Rurik Ironnist][Rurik] awakens in a luxurious, if well used bed. The last thing he remembers was drinking in [The Swinging Sword Inn][Inn] after a journey along The Long Road from [Waterdeep][Waterdeep]. He'd come to town in escort of a priest [Sister Garaele][Garaele] who needed safe passage to the town of [Red Larch][Red Larch], a backwater trade town in the [Dessarin Valley][Dessarin Valley]. [Rurik Ironnist][Rurik] only took the job to try and raise money for a brewery he was looking to start in [Waterdeep][Waterdeep] with a [Mirabarn][Mirabar] partner named _(Patrick fill this in!)_. He and the escort party, made of a Human Fighter named ____, a Dragonkin Sorcerer and a Elven Warlock stopped in the Inn for some relaxation after depositing the priest at her Altar. Unfortunately he doesn't remember much after that other then maybe drinking too much. He assumes the headache to be the effects of a hangover.

Assessing his surroundings he notices that not only are his party members asleep in the room with him, but there is also a giant Goliath with a small gnome resting upon him. More surprising is a _____ floating in the corner, also asleep. He tries to awake his compatriots to no avail and is uneasy when he hears footsteps at the door. The Innkeeper [Kaylessa Irkell][Kaylessa] enters the room and introduces herself as if _____ already knew her. She recounts the bits that Patrick vaguely remembers: that he was drinking heavily with his friends, talked a little too much about his fighting prowess and drinking abilities and made a mess of her bar. Kaylessa tells him that near the end of the night he accepted a challenge from some locals to scout of the area of Lance Rock, where a strange darkness had come over the last few months.

Kaylessa remembers ____ and the party leaving for Lance Rock that night but knowing the area enough to know its danger felt worried for the tipsy Dwarf and made a call to the local Order of the Gauntlet chapter asking for help. Days later, a quiet Paladin dropped not only ___ party, but an additional four adventures on her doorstep. He said he found them passed out with only a piece of parchment that contained a weird symbol in the Dwarf's pocket. Showing this symbol to ___ rises his memory and he flashes back to the cavern entrance of Lance Rock.

## The Necromancer's Cave

After a short journey ____ and his party arrive within sight of Lance Rock, noticable for the large, rocky spire that rises from the dusty landscape. By happenstance they run into a Gnome Druid named ____ who, along with a Goliath barbarian and a ____ ranger, were in pursuit of a Necromancer who'd killed a forest noble's daughter. After a short dialog, the two parties decide to join up and venture into the cave.

On entry ____ sees a body ahead and takes a few steps towards it before passing out flat on his face, the drink finally having caught up to him. The party approaches the body, seeing the same parchment Kaylessa would later find. The body awakens and is in fact a Zombie. They place the parchment with the strange symbol in ____'s pocket and place him in some secluded brush before venturing futher.

After a couple scuffles with more zombies the party makes their way to a rickety stage, where some form of play is being put upon by zombies in costume. On further investigation, someone triggers a pitfall trap from behind a peephole on the other side of the stage. This person directs the Zombies to attack and escapes away from the peephole. After a lengthy battle where ____ the barbarian is saved by ____ the gnome, the party makes their way into the main atrium.
